								Since she was 5, Emma has always loved to cook and bake for her family. Her grandma was her very first influence and taught her all the basics. As she got older, she started experimenting with new recipes and trying new techniques. Now, Emma is a confident cook and loves to spend time with others cooking and sharing recipes.

								Emma was first introduced to fashion through the top model coloring books she received as presents for christmas when she was small. As she grew up, Emma lost her interest in fashion and was more interested in which outfit she should wear to play football at lunch rather than style.
								<br>
								<br>
								Now, Emma has reconnected with fashion and is a major part of her life. She loves to dress and combine different styles of clothes to create her own looks. Emma also loves vintage clothes, especially the ones that are passed down to her from her grandma and great-grandma.
